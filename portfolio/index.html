                    <p> My name is Okikiola Sanni. I live in Santry, Dublin, which is only a few minutes from Dublin City University. I am a gentle and friendly person. I love meeting new people, and getting to know them. My hobbies are dancing, singing, researching new topics, studying and observing, and chatting. </p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p> I have worked in Beaumont Hospital located in Dublin, for ten years. I worked as a Staff Nurse in the Accident and Emergency Derpartment. I find this department dynamic, onerous and progressive. Over the last ten years, I was able to gather some skills and qualities which include communication, interpersonal, listening,flexibility, determination and persistence, willingness to add to my knowledge base and skill, problem solving, and most especially, team-work and computer skill.</p>
					<p> Some of my responsibilities were, but not limited to the following:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Assisting with checking in patients, doing triage work for doctors and generating initial insurance paperwork.</li>
					<li>Maintaining care standards in accident and emergency.</li>
					<li>Maintaining contact with laboratory personnel to report any initial lab findings back to the Accident and Emmergency doctors.</li>
					<li>Working with doctors to keep patients and their family members updated on test results or treatment recommendations.</li>
					<li>Making arrangements for patients that are deemed to need care requiring them to be admitted to the hospital for one night or longer</li>
					</ul>
				    <p>The part I love about being an Accident and Emergency Nurse is being able to build close relationship with patients. They feel relieved having someone to discuss with. I understand how lonely they can feel sometimes being in their room alone: it can be depressing.</p>
